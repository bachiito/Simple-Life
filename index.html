                do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.

              <h2>Simplicity and work</h2>
              <p>
                Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated,
                it ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout.
                By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help
                balance everything out.

              <h2>Simple decorations</h2>
              <p>
                A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People
                either don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have
                the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw
                the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never
                before.
